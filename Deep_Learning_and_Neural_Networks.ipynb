        "In this exercise, we will combine the speech recognition and chatbot algorithms to create a speech-enabled chatbot. The chatbot will take voice input from the user, transcribe it into text using the speech recognition algorithm, and then use the chatbot algorithm to generate a response.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. First, import the necessary packages in your code. This includes nltk, streamlit, and speech_recognition.\n",
        "2. Load the text file and preprocess the data using the chatbot algorithm.\n",
        "3. Define a function to transcribe speech into text using the speech recognition algorithm.\n",
        "4. Modify the chatbot function to take both text and speech input from the user. If the user provides text input, the chatbot should function as before.\n",
        " If the user provides speech input, the speech recognition algorithm should transcribe the speech into text, which is then passed to the chatbot.\n",
        "5. Create a Streamlit app that allows the user to provide either text or speech input to the chatbot. If the user provides text input, the chatbot should function as before. If the user provides speech input, the speech recognition algorithm should transcribe the speech into text, which is then passed to the chatbot. The chatbot's response should be displayed to the user.\n",
        "6. Test the chatbot with both text and speech input to ensure that it functions correctly.\n",
